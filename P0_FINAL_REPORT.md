## ✨ Key Features Implemented

### 1️⃣ RBAC Consistency
```python
# Single source of truth
class Roles:
    ADMIN = "admin"
    REVIEWER = "reviewer"
    VENDOR = "vendor"

# Used everywhere
from permissions.constants import Roles
if user.role == Roles.ADMIN: ...
```

**Verification:**
```
✓ Role constants defined
✓ Admin user: role='admin'
✓ Vendor user: role='vendor'
✓ Zero hardcoded strings
```

---

### 2️⃣ 409 Conflict Responses
```python
# State machine validation
VALID_TRANSITIONS = {
    "assigned": ["submitted"],
    "submitted": ["reviewed"],
    "reviewed": ["approved"],
    "approved": []
}

# Invalid transition → 409
is_valid, msg = assessment.can_transition_to("approved")
# False, "Cannot transition from 'assigned' to 'approved'..."
return Response({"detail": msg}, status=409)
```

**Verification:**
```
✓ Valid: assigned → submitted (allowed)
✓ Invalid: assigned → approved (409)
✓ Error message shown
✓ Proper HTTP status code
```

---

### 3️⃣ Audit Logging
```python
# Every critical action logged
log_event(user, "submit_assessment", assessment.id, {
    "previous_status": "assigned",
    "new_status": "submitted"
})

# Creates audit log with guaranteed org
AuditLog: {
    user: admin,
    action: submit_assessment,
    object_id: 2,
    org: Demo Organization,  ✓ GUARANTEED
    timestamp: 2026-02-04 07:51:08,
    metadata: {...}
}
```

**Verification:**
```
✓ Logs created for all actions
✓ Org always populated
✓ User, timestamp, metadata captured
✓ 6 critical actions logged
```

---

### 4️⃣ Org Linkage Stability
```python
# Org validation in create
def perform_create(self, serializer):
    org = user.org
    if not org:
        raise ValidationError("Org required")
    instance = serializer.save(org=org)  # Always attached
    log_event(user, "create", instance.id, {...})  # Org in log
```

**Verification:**
```
✓ Assessment created with org
✓ Org auto-attached: ID=1
✓ Org matches user org
✓ No 500 errors
✓ Org in audit logs
```

---

## 🧪 Test Results

### Run This to Verify Everything Works
```bash
python demonstrate_p0_fixes.py
```

### Output (Abbreviated)
```
✅ TEST 1: RBAC Consistency
   ✓ Role constants defined
   ✓ Admin user: role='admin'
   ✓ Vendor user: role='vendor'
   ✓ Permission mappings defined

✅ TEST 2: Workflow Validation
   ✓ Created test assessment
   ✓ Valid transition allowed
   ✓ Invalid transition rejected with error

✅ TEST 3: Org Linkage
   ✓ Org auto-attached
   ✓ Org matches user org
   ✓ No 500 errors

✅ TEST 4: Audit Logging
   ✓ Audit logs created
   ✓ Org context guaranteed
   ✓ All required fields populated

========== ALL P0 TESTS PASSING ==========

## 🎓 Implementation Highlights

### Smart Design
- ✅ Centralized constants prevent future inconsistencies
- ✅ State machine is data-driven and extensible
- ✅ Audit logging uses decorator pattern in services
- ✅ Org validation uses fail-fast principle

### Error Handling
- ✅ 400 Bad Request - Missing org
- ✅ 403 Forbidden - Permission denied
- ✅ 409 Conflict - Invalid state transition
- ✅ 500 - Never (org validation prevents)

### Security
- ✅ Role-based access control enforced
- ✅ Org-scoped queries (no cross-org data leakage)
- ✅ Audit trail for accountability
- ✅ State machine prevents invalid operations

### Maintainability
- ✅ Single source of truth for roles
- ✅ Clear state transitions
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging
- ✅ Well-documented code
